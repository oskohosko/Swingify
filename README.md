# Swingify

A Golf App I created that shows the hole you are playing, displays distances and projects a 10% dispersion onto the map for each club in your bag.

# Overview
Was created over 6 weeks while learning my first IOS App Development Unit. 
Will continue to update and build upon the app to further suit my needs and help improve my golf!

# Functionalities

## Select Club
Can add clubs and their distance to your bag.
When on the course, you can select from a drop down and choose a club.
A 10% dispersion based on the distance of the club will be displayed originally in the direction of the green.
You can double tap anywhere on the map while the dispersion is displayed to change its direction.
A single tap on the dispersion ring will display the distance for a brief period of time.

## Distances
Holding down on a position on the map will place a pin and a distance to that pin from your location.
If location hasn't been approved, the teebox is the location the distance is measured from.
Simply tap the pin to remove it from the map.

## Elevation Adjustment
A toggleable elevation switch will generate adjusted distances which take elevation into account.
Uphill = Longer, Downhill = Shorter.

## Home Course and Favourites
You can select your home course on your profile and save courses to your favourites to save time when navigating to the course you are playing.
